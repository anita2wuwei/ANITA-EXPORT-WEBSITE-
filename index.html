  <h3>About WW Export</h3>

  <p>
    Founded in 2021, WW Export was established after years of hands-on involvement in global manufacturing and international trade.
    Before forming our own company, our team had already served hundreds of enterprises across electronics, consumer products,
    and industrial supply chains.
  </p>

  <p>
    We specialize in cleaning appliances, smart short-distance mobility, and energy storage products,
    providing OEM / ODM solutions tailored to global markets.
  </p>

  <p>
    What differentiates us is not scale, but depth of experience.
    Our core members have spent decades inside real enterprises — growing with them from early stages
    through expansion, system building, and globalization.
  </p>

<!-- Core Team -->
<section class="core-team">
  <h3>Core Team</h3>

  <div class="team-item">
    <h4>Supply Chain & Compliance Leadership</h4>
    <p>
      With over 16 years at a multinational enterprise, one of our core executives joined the company at an early stage
      and progressed from procurement assistant to procurement manager, and later audit and compliance management roles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having personally experienced the company's journey from growth to public listing, he brings a deep understanding
      of supplier development, internal control systems, and scalable global operations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="team-item">
    <h4>Quality & Manufacturing Expertise</h4>
    <p>
      Our quality lead has over 20 years of manufacturing experience, growing from frontline engineering roles
      to senior quality management positions in leading enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ensures a strong focus on process discipline, root cause analysis, and long-term product stability,
      rather than short-term inspection-based quality control.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="team-item">
    <h4>Business Execution & Trade Coordination</h4>
    <p>
      Our business execution lead combines commercial insight with operational depth.
      With hands-on experience in production line efficiency calculation, SOP development,
      and coordination with regulatory and governmental authorities,
      she ensures projects move from concept to shipment smoothly and compliantly.
    </p>
